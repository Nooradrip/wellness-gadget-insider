    question: "What is health and wellness?",
    answer: "Health and wellness represent the holistic integration of physical, mental and emotional wellbeing through proactive lifestyle choices. Wellness extends beyond mere absence of illness to include active pursuit of optimal functioning across all life dimensions. This comprehensive approach encompasses preventive care, healthy habits and balanced living. It's a continuous journey toward achieving one's full potential in all aspects of life."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the definition of health and wellbeing?",
    answer: "Health refers to the physical state of the body including absence of disease and proper physiological functioning. Wellbeing encompasses broader life satisfaction, purpose and emotional resilience that contribute to quality of life. Together they form a holistic concept that addresses both biological and psychosocial aspects of human existence. True health and wellbeing enable individuals to thrive in their daily activities and relationships."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you define good health and wellness?",
    answer: "Good health and wellness manifest as sustained energy levels, emotional balance and resilience to stress. It involves maintaining physical fitness through proper nutrition and exercise while cultivating mental clarity and emotional stability. Wellness is reflected in positive social connections and a sense of purpose in daily activities. Ultimately it's characterized by the capacity to prevent illness and recover quickly from health challenges."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the 5 aspects of health and wellbeing?",
    answer: "The five core aspects include physical wellbeing (nutrition, exercise, sleep), emotional wellbeing (stress management, resilience), social wellbeing (meaningful relationships), intellectual wellbeing (continuous learning) and spiritual wellbeing (purpose, values). Each dimension contributes uniquely to overall wellness and requires balanced attention. These interconnected elements work synergistically to create comprehensive health foundations. Neglecting any single aspect can compromise the entire wellbeing ecosystem."
